 Class to display a Rewarded Video Ad.
 Videos are full screen advertisements that are shown at natural transition points in your application
 such as between game levels, when switching news stories, in general when transitioning from one view controller
 to another. It's best to request for a video some time before when it's actually needed, so it can preload it's
 content and become ready to present, and when the time comes, it can be immediately presented to the user
 with a smooth experience.
