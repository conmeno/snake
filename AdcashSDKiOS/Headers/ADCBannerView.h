 Special refreshRate value, indicating that the refreshRate will be retrieved by the Adcash's server.
 
 @discussion The value that is retrieved from the server is the same as the one that you have 
 specified in your [Adcash Publisher Panel](https://www.adcash.com/console/scripts.php) for this zone id.
 
 Please note that in case you disable auto refresh
 for this zone id in your [Adcash Publisher Panel](https://www.adcash.com/console/scripts.php),
 then this ADCBannerView instance will not auto refresh anymore even though you go and revert the change.
